Welcome to the MatRANS model, for simulating simple one-dimensional vertical (1DV) boundary layer flows.  The model solves Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with k-omega turbulence closure, coupled with bed and suspended load sediment transport.


Set up cases for the book:

Sumer, B.M. and Fuhrman, D.R. (2020) Turbulence in Coastal and Civil Engineering. World Scientific. DOI: 10.1142/10829 

can be found beneath the MatRANS/TurbulenceBook/ directory.


The remaining MatRANS file structure is organized as follows:

MatRANS/src: Contains source code for current release.
MatRANS/src_old: Contains source code for previous releases.
MatRANS/Examples: Contains over 20 set up examples for simulating steady and wave boundary layers.
MatRANS/ModelDescription: Contains a LaTeX document describing the model (This only describes the original implementation, and does not describe extensions to include the transitional turbulence model and sediment mixtures).
MatRANS/Courses: Contains files for simulations utilized in courses at DTU.
MatRANS/Work: Intended as a working directory for new users to organize new applications.

Brief description of versions: 
1.0: Basic turbulence and sediment transport models (Fuhrman et al. 2013)
2.0: Extended to include (1) transitional turbulence model (Williams and Fuhrman 2016) and (2) sediment mixtures (Caliskan and Fuhrman 2017)
2.1: Bug fix in transitional model, with updated setup for the relevant Examples (steady currents on smooth/rough beds as well as solitary wave boundary layers).

This is version 2.1.


Have fun!
