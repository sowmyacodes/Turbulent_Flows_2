This case uses a constant pressure gradient to develop a 
rough-turbulent steady current, starting from motionless initial
 conditions.  Results are compared with a standard logarithmic velocity
profile, the parabolic eddy viscosity profile (matches computed
 results for the lower half of the channel), and the Vanoni 
distribution for the suspended sediment concentration profile.
