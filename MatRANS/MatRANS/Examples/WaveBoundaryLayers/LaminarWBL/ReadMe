This case computes two successive periods of a laminar wave boundary
 layer, using the laminar theoretical solution as the initial condition. 
 As the case is laminar, the turbulence model is switched off (turb=0).  Results 
for the velocity profiles are compared against the theoretical
solution for numerous phases.  The resulting time series of the bed shear
 stress is additionally compared with the theoretical solution.
