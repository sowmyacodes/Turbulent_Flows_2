This case considers a turbulent boundary layer simulation based on 
the Indian Ocean tsunami from December 26, 2004.  For this purpose 
depth measurements made by a depth-finder on Thomas Siffer's yacht 
Mercator (see e.g Madsen and Fuhrman 2008, p. 216) are digitized,
and converted to velocities (based on shallow-water scaling).  This 
is done using scripts contained within the /Data subfolder.  These 
velocities (and corresponding accelerations) are then used to drive 
the flow within the model.  Hence this case serves as an example on 
how to drive the model based on a user-defined signal.  In the
comparison, the resulting flow and turbulence profiles are animated.  
Additionally, the computed velocity time series from the top of the 
model domain is compared with that based on the converted original 
digitized data.  


In addition to the set up provided, changing to iwave=4 will simulate this case with the velocity approximated by an N-wave signal, based on that used by Madsen and Schaffer (2010).  Similarly, changing to iwave=5 will simulate this case with the signal approximated via a superposition of three sech()^2 signals, essentially as proposed by Chan and Liu (2012).  Both options were utilized in MatRANS simulation of tsunami wave boundary layers by Williams and Fuhrman (2016).
