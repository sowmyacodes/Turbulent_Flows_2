A laminar wave boundary layer on a sloping bed is computed
 i.e. converging-diverging convective acceleration effects are active.  Upon completion, the
 period-averaged velocity profile is animated, and the computed results
 are compared against the laminar theoretical solution obtained by 
Bijker et al. (1974).
