In this directory you will find several example set up cases, which test essentially all of the features developed within this model.  To run them, be sure that the MatRANS/src (source code) directory is in your Matlab path e.g.:

>> addpath path/to/my/MatRANS/src

or alternatively set this up in MatRANS/src/startup_MatRANS.m, and simply execute this script.


The (approx. 22 set up) cases are logically organized as follows:

In /CurrentFlows (5 tutorial examples):
/Laminar: Tests simulated laminar current profile against theory (turbulence model off)
/Turbulent/Smooth: Tests hydraulically smooth steady current versus data (standard k-omega model)
/Turbulent/Rough: Tests hydraulically rough steady current versus data (standard k-omega model)
/Turbulent/SmoothTransitional: Re-tests smooth case, but with transitional k-omega model
/Turbulent/RoughTransitional: Re-tests rough case, but with transitional k-omega model

In /WaveBoundaryLayers (10 tutorial examples):
/LaminarWBL: Tests laminar oscillatory boundary layer simulation against theory
/TurbulentWBL: Tests (rough and smooth) oscillatory turbulent wave boundary layer results against data
/StreamingLaminar: Test laminar progressive wave boundary layer streaming against theory
/StreamingTurbulent/Symmetric: Tests progressive turbulent wave boundary layer streaming against independent numerical results
/StreamingTurbulent/Asymmetric: Similarly, tests and demonstrates turbulence-induced streaming beneath velocity-skewed wave signal against independent numerical results
/ConvergingDivergingLaminar: Tests converging-diverging oscillatory flow against laminar theory
/ConvergingDivergingTurbulent: Tests converging-diverging oscillatory flow against data
/SolitaryWaveBoundaryLayer: Demonstrates/tests transitional turbulence model against theory/data for a solitary wave boundary layer flow
/TsunamiMercator: Demonstrates an application where a digital velocity time series (in this case from the Indian Ocean 2004 tsunami) is used to drive a time-varying boundary layer flow.  Slight modifications also include use of N-wave and superipmosed sech()^2 wave shapes.

In /WavePlusCurrent (3 tutorial examples):
These cases demonstrate simulation of combined wave-plus-current boundary layer, as well as with the pure current or pure wave simulated separately.  The combined result is compared with a turbulent theory.

In /SedimentTransport (4 tutorial examples)
/VanoniDistribution: Tests computed suspended sediment concentration profile against the Vanoni distribution in a turbulent steady flow
/SedimentTransportWaves: Tests computed sediment fluxes against measuremenets (two cases, involving fine and medium sands)
/GradedSedimentTransportWaves: Demonstrates additional use of graded sediment (multiple grain sizes) transport beneath velocity-skewed free stream flow.

Each tutorial also comes with its own ReadMe file, so please consult these for further details.

Have fun!
