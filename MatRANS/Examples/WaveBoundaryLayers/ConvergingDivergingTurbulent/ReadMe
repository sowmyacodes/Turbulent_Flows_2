This case considers an oscillatory wave boundary layer in a
convergent-divergent tunnel, as studied experimentally by Sumer et
al. (1993).  The case considered corresponds to their Test 16
conditions.  Upon completing the simulation, the period-averaged
velocity profile is animated through time until a steady state is
reached.  The resulting profile is then compared with the
measurements.  As the simulation only covers the bottom half of the
tunnel, the computed results are reflected across the top boundary for
presentation purposes.  Note that this simulation is similar to that
leading to Figure 8 of Fuhrman et al. (2013).
