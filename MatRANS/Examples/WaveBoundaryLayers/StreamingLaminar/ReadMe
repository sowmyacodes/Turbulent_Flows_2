This case simulates a laminar wave boundary layer (turbulence model
 switched off), buth with active convective terms to promote boundary layer streaming.  The resulting
 period-averaged velocity profile is then compared against the
theoretical solution of Longuet-Higgins (1958).  The period-averaged
 dimensionless bed shear stress is also checked, which compares very
 well against the expected theoretical value (1/4).
