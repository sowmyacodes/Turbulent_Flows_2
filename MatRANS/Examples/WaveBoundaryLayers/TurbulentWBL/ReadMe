In these cases the model simulates the wave boundary layer beneath an
 oscillatory (sinusoidal) free stream flow.  Both a hydraulically 
smooth and rough case are considered, corresponding respectively to 
test 10 and test 13 of Jensen et al. (1989).  Comparisons with 
measurements are made for the velocity profiles, turbulent kinetic
 energy profiles, and Reynolds stress profiles at various phases.
  Additionally, comparison with measured friction velocity time series
are made.
