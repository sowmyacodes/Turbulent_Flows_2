These cases consider two example simulations involving sediment
transport beneath velocity-skewed wave signals, including high
-concentration effects (hindered settling velocities and turbulence 
damping due to density gradients in the water-sand mixture).  
Specifically, cases FA5010 and MA5010 from O'Donogue and Wright (2004)
 are simulated, which respectively involve the sheet-flow transport of 
fine and medium sand grains in oscillating tunnel conditions.  The 
computed period-averaged and instanteous suspended sediment flux
profiles at various phases are compared with measured profiles.  The
 fine-sand case (FA5010) results in negative (offshore) net sediment
transport rates due to importance of phase-lag effects, whereas the 
medium sand case (MA5010) results in positive (onshore) net sediment
transport rates.  Note that these simulations are the basis for Figure 
10, 11, and 12a,d in Fuhrman et al. (2013).
