Standard turbulence model:
These cases (Smooth and Rough directories) use the model 
to simulate the development of steady currents on both hydraulically 
smooth and rough conditions, using the standard k-omega model.  Computed velocity and turbulent kinetic 
energy profiles are compared to measurements from Fuhrman et al. (2010) 
for the same conditions.

 

To run (both cases):
>>MatRANS;

>>Compare;

Transitional turbulence model:
Additionally, in the SmoothTransitional and RoughTransitional directories, these cases are re-considered using the transitional turbulence model
 (i.e. set turb=2) of Wilcox (2006, pp. 200-211).  



To run (both cases):
